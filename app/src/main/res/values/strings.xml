    <string name="rules">The oldest player begins (setting the example for the younger kids). Reach into the monster bag and feel around for an item to place in the blank spaces on your bedroom board. \n With your hand in the bag, try to distinguish between the different pieces, and decide which one feels as if it\'s the size and shape of a piece you need. \n If you pull out a puzzle piece you need for your board, place it on the correct spot on your bedroom board. (Keep in mind that the puzzle pieces are interchangeable. Some pieces may look better on some boards than on others, but there\'s no right or wrong way to decorate the room). If you pull out a puzzle piece you already have, give it to another player who needs it. \n\n If you pull out a monster, toss it into the center of the circle (we call it the monster pit, some kids like to call it jail) and say, go away monster!... or sit on it, or hide it in the box, or throw it out the door. You decide how to get rid of those silly monsters. After all, you\'re in charge! One by one, moving around the circle to the left, take turns removing an item from the bag. Once you pull out an item - whether you keep it, share it, or toss it - your turn is over. Pass the bag to the player on your left. In the competitive game play, the object is to be the first to fill your bedroom board. The set-up and game play are the same as in the cooperative version, with a couple of exceptions. First, you want to avoid pulling a monster out of the bag so you can hurry to get all the puzzle pieces you need for your board. If you pull out a monster, it will just slow you down, so you need to get really good at discriminating between the shapes and sizes of the different pieces. \n Second, if you pull out a puzzle piece you already have, put it back in the bag and pass the monster bag to the next player. \n Once you pull out an item - whether you keep it, put it back, or toss it - your turn is over. Pass the bag to the player on your left. \n The first player to complete her board wins the game. Look over all the monsters and the puzzle pieces. Pick them up and see how they feel. You\'ll find that some monsters are about the same size and shape as the bedroom puzzle pieces.</string>
